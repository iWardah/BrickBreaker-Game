The game is basically a recreation of the popular Brick Breaker game. The player has the following controls controls:
• A to move paddle left
• D to move paddle right
• P to pause the game for a few seconds • Q to quit the game
For a more user friendly display, the screen has the bricks in different colours and a lot of the positions like the ball’s initial position can be easily changed which allows for a nicer interface. Additionally, it has an added difficulty because each brick needs to be hit 3 times to be fully gone
